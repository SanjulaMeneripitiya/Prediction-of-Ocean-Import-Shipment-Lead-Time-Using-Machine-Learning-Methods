# Prediction-of-Ocean-Import-Shipment-Lead-Time-Using-Machine-Learning-Methods

## Abstract

In this project, I analyzed import shipment data to predict lead time for sea shipment using machine learning techniques. I trained and evaluated logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting models on a dataset containing 7 categorical variables and 1 continuous target variable. I split the data into training and testing sets, tuned hyperparameters using grid search cross-validation, and repeated the process 100 times to get a more accurate estimate of each model's performance. The results showed that random forests and gradient boosting had the highest accuracy scores, while logistic regression had the highest precision score. Additionally, I evaluated the models' accuracy using mean absolute error and mean squared error. The analysis provides insights into how machine learning can improve lead time predictions for sea shipment in the import shipment industry.
